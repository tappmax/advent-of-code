# Scaffolding

`run npm scaffold` to quickly scaffold a new project in this directory. You'll then want to rename the directory and package name it makes, then you can get to coding.

# Running tests / start

Copy the input data file to the build/src/test and build/src folders. Both in case you want the test code and node code to both be able to pull the file in.

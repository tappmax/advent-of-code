# Ughhhh

I accidentally deleted the first 3 days' solutions trying to set up a branch on git. I can't do anything to get them back and don't feel like doing it again. Day 2's main file made it though. So my advent of code calendar starts properly on day 4.

# Scaffolding

`run npm scaffold` to quickly scaffold a new project in this directory. You'll then want to rename the directory and package name it makes, then you can get to coding.
